# Instagram-Database

This program (igdb.c) has 5 available options when it is run. It can either list (which prints out the whole database formatted as a table), add (adds a new entry to the end of the database, with a prompt to add a comment), update (updates an existing entry for the given handle), save (writes the database out to the file database.csv) or exit (quits the program, but warns the user about unsaved changes if any).
